# Unlocking-Olympic-Data-SQL-Insights-into-Decades-of-Games

This project focuses on analyzing the 120 years of Olympics history dataset using SQL queries. The dataset consists of two tables: "dataset_olympics.csv" and "noc_region.csv". The "dataset_olympics" table contains information about athletes, their teams, the Olympic Games they participated in, and the medals they won. The "noc_region" table provides the mapping between the National Olympic Committee codes (NOC) and the corresponding regions.
